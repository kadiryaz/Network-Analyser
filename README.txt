Network analyser is a simple program for detecting anomalies from network packages.
It has 3 modes.
1.Sniffing
2.Reading From Pcap File
3.Reading From CicFLowmeter (.csv) output



To train or use your CicFLowmeter (.csv) output data, first you should prepare it with columnNameConverter.py
After that you can run Trainer.py by only changing csvFileName variable in the code. 

Once you ready for analysing, you can directly run NetworkAnalyser.py.

Enjoy it and don't hesitate to change it.
